   <h2>Here's a time line of Dr. Borlaug's life:</h2>
      <ul><li>1914 - Born in Cresco, Iowa</li>
          <li>1933 - Leaves his family's farm to attend the University of Minnesota,<br />
                     thanks to a Depression era program known as the "National Youth<br />
                     Administration"</li>
          <li>1935 - Has to stop school and save up more money. Works in the Civilian <br />
                     Conservation Corps, helping starving Americans. "I saw how food <br />
                     changed them", he said. "All of this left scars on me."</li>
          <li>1937 - Finishes university and takes a job in the US Forestry Service</li>
          <li>1938 - Marries wife of 69 years Margret Gibson. Gets laid off due to <br /> 
                     budget cuts. Inspired by Elvin Charles Stakman, he returns to school <br />
                     study under Stakman, who teaches him about breeding pest-resistent <br />
                     plants.</li>
          <li>1941 - Tries to enroll in the military after the Pearl Harbor attack, but is <br />
                     rejected. Instead, the military asked his lab to work on waterproof glue, <br />
                     DDT to control malaria, disenfectants, and other applied science.</li>
          <li>1942 - Receives a Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Pathology</li>
          <li>1944 - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont, leaves behind his <br /> 
                     pregnant wife and flies to Mexico to head a new plant pathology <br />
                     program. Over the next 16 years, his team breads 6000 different strains <br /> 
                     of disease resistant wheat - including different varieties for each major <br /> 
                     climate on Earth.</li>
          <li>1945 - Discovers a way to grow wheat twice each season, doubling <br />
                     wheat yields</li>
          <li>1953 - Crosses a short, sturdy dwarf bread of wheat with a high-yielding <br />
                     American bread, creating a strain that responds well to fertilizer. It goes <br />
                     on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.</li>
          <li>1962 - Visits Delhi and brings high yielding strains of wheat to the <br />
                     Indian Subcontinent in time to help mitigate mass starvation due to a <br />
                     rapidly expanding population</li>
          <li>1970 - receives the Nobel Peace Prize</li>
          <li>1983 - helps seven African countries dramatically increase their maize <br />
                     and sorghum yields</li>
          <li>1984 - becomes a distinguished professor at Texas A&M University</li>
          <li>2005 - states "we will have to double the world food supply by 2050." <br /> 
                     Argues that genetically modified crops are the only way we can meet the <br />
                     demand, as we run out of arable land. Says that GM crops are not <br />
                     inherently dangerous because "we've been genetically modifying plants <br />
                     and animals for a long time. Long before we called it science, people <br />
                     were selecting the best breeds.</li>
          <li>2009 - dies at the age of 95.</li>
      </ul>

      "Borlaug's life and achievement are the testimony to the far-reaching contribution that one man's towering 
         intellect, persistence and scientific vision can make to human<br />peace and progress."
          <br/><br/>-- Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh<br />
